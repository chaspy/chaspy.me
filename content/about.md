Engineering Manager, Site Reliability at [Recruit Co., Ltd.](https://www.recruit.co.jp/) (Oct, 2021~), formaerly [Quipper](http://www.quipper.com) (Jul,2018〜).

I have six years of experience as a software engineer. Of that, I have two years of experience as a Site Reliability Engineer.

I'm good at implementing the necessary technologies and processes for organizations. I recently introduced a central theme, SLI/SLO, to both Japanese and global products and promoted it to a situation where developers can handle it themselves.

As a team and project lead, I can find a problem correctly and take the team forward through communication and facilitation.

I completed technical projects with a high degree of uncertainty and impact, such as migrating a Kubernetes Cluster from self-hosted to EKS and OS upgrades for Reverse Proxy.

I can communicate and discuss in English. As an SRE, I have introduced new technologies and processes to global product teams and supported their development productivity.
